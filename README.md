# Codevelop
  Codevelop is a clone of OKCupid, focusing on finding coding pairs for programmers rather than finding dates.

##Guide to Repo
  Codevelop is a project grounded in Rails, with heavy use of Backbone in order to make the site single page.
  As such you'll find the majority of the heavy lifting code in the App/Assets/Javascripts Folder. Additionally you may wish to investigate the API controllers and Routes files to see how data is moved between Rails and Javascript. Finally, if you're curious about the styling (intended to be very faithful to OKCupid's original styling) you can check out the stylesheets.
